This bash script is designed to save and restore the state of tmux sessions and windows, though it notes that restoring the state and position of panes is still a TODO and thus not currently implemented. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

### `dump` function

-   Uses `tmux list-windows -a -F` to list all tmux windows across all sessions in a specific format, including the session name, window name, and the current path of the pane. This output is formatted with tab delimiters.

### `save` function

-   Calls the `dump` function and redirects its output to a file (`~/.tmux-session`). This file will contain a record of all sessions, their windows, and the current working directories of those windows.

### `terminal_size` function

-   Uses `stty size` to get the terminal's size (width and height) and formats it in a way suitable for creating a new tmux session with specified dimensions.

### `session_exists` function

-   Checks if a tmux session with the given name already exists.

### `add_window` function

-   Adds a new window to an existing tmux session with the specified name and directory as the starting path.

### `new_session` function

-   Changes to the specified directory and creates a new tmux session with a given name and window name, also applying terminal dimensions if provided.

### `restore` function

-   Starts the tmux server, reads the `~/.tmux-session` file line by line, and restores sessions by either adding windows to existing sessions or creating new sessions as needed. It specifically avoids directories that do not exist and windows named "log" or "man". It also prints the number of sessions restored.

### Script Execution

-   The script accepts two commands (`save` or `restore`) passed as the first argument (`$1`). Depending on the command, it either saves the current tmux state to `~/.tmux-session` or attempts to restore sessions from this file.
-   If an invalid command is passed, it prints a usage message and exits with an error.

### How it Works in Practice

-   To save the current state of tmux sessions: `./script_name save`
-   To restore tmux sessions from the saved state: `./script_name restore`

The script is useful for preserving your work environment across system restarts or when disconnecting from remote sessions. However, it does not yet handle pane splits within windows, nor does it restore programs running within those panes, only their locations and the window names within sessions.
